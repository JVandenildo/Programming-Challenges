# About

Create a function to find only the root value of `x` in any quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c`. The function will take three arguments:

- `a` as the coefficient of `x^2`;
- `b` as the coefficient of `x`;
- `c` as the constant term.

Examples:

- `quadraticEquation(1, 2, -3) → 1`;
- `quadraticEquation(2, -7, 3) → 3`;
- `quadraticEquation(1, -12, -28) → 14`.

Notes:

- Quadratic equations is always guaranteed to have have a root;
- Calculate only the root that sums the square root of the discriminant, not the one that subtracts it;
- Round the value/return only integer value.
