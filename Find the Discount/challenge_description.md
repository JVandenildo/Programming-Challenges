# About

Create a function that takes two arguments: the original `price` and the `discount` percentage as integers and returns the final price after the discount. Examples:  
`dis(1500, 50) → 750`  
`dis(89, 20) → 71.2`  
`dis(100, 75) → 25`

**Note**: the answer should be rounded to two decimal places.
