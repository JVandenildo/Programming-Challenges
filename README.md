# About

This repository is to cover a solution for challenges I find throughout the wildness of world wide web (a.k.a internet). For now I use only C++, Python or Rust to solve them, feel free to try with other languages or find a better solution with theses ones.  
The sources I use for challenge are:

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives);
- [edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges).
