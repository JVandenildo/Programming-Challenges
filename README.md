# About  

This repository is to cover a solution to logic challenges I found throughout the wildness of world wide web (a.k.a internet). For now I use only C++ or Python to solve it, feel free to try with other languages or find a better solution with theses ones.  
The main source, but not the only one, of challenge is [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
