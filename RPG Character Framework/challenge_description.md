# About

Code in C++ was given, and the user must work on it in order to fulfill the challenge.

## Challenge description

Create classes to act as character in a turn-based RPG. Test functions will be used to simulate player input.

- Characters should start at least at level 1.
- You've been provided with a starting point. Private variables should stay private.
- You must replace the base class's virtual methods with your own class' implementations.
- Players should gain an enemy's `_xpReward` when they win a fight.
- Players should level up if their `_xp` is greater than 100.
- Enemy `_xpReward` should be equal to 5 times their level plus 1/4 their attack and 1/4 their defense (rounded down).
- Any character should be able to win and lose a fight. Don't think you'll succeed just because the player always wins!
- Don't try to modify or implement anything in `Char_base`.
